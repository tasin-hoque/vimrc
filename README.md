In this repo, I'm storing my VSCode settings and keybindings.
I used to code with vanilla vim but later realized that I can't 
just live without the VS Code featuers. That's why I switched to
VS Code (with the vim extension) eventually. The vim emulator is a bit glitchy but if you
can break your habbit of keeping the j/k key pressed for vertical
navigation (and instead get used to relative numbers), the emulator
will be a little more user friendly.
